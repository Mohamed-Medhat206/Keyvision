# KeyVision 🖥️🔐

**KeyVision** is a personal project built using **Python**, **PyQt5**, and **Flask**. It’s a real-time network monitoring and key logging system designed to help administrators observe system performance and user input across a local network.

This project was created to increase my skills in Python, desktop development, client-server communication, and database integration.
